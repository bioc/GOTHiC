Package: GOTHiC
Title: Binomial test for Hi-C data analysis
Description: This is a Hi-C analysis package using a cumulative
        binomial test to detect interactions between distal genomic
        loci that have significantly more reads than expected by chance
        in Hi-C experiments. It takes mapped paired NGS reads as input
        and gives back the list of significant interactions for a given
        bin size in the genome.
